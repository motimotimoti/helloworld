# TwitterStreams

Rough hack around TwRequest (by using signedURLRequest) to enable use of the streaming API.

## Setup

Requires JSONKit, but you can just:

git submodule init
git submodule update

## Example project

A User and Filter stream are provided as an example.

## Careful!

Expect bugs and leaks :)
